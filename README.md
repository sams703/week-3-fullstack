# React + Tailwind Week 3 Assignment

This project is a complete React (JSX-only) + Tailwind CSS starter that fulfills the Week 3 assignment: components, hooks, context, API integration, and responsive styling.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Run dev server:
   npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- Make sure you run the dev command from the project root (the folder that contains package.json and vite.config.mjs).
- If you encounter an ESM error related to vite config, ensure 'type': 'module' is in package.json or use vite.config.mjs (this project uses vite.config.mjs).
